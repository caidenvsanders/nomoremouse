# About

NoMoreMouse was created to help developers increase their productivity by ditching the mouse and mastering the art of the keyboard. Many developers these days just throw up an instance of VSCode, add a couple of extensions for languages here and there, then call it good. The goal of this project is to share the love of programming with a keyboard, spreading it out to all the new programmers as well as the oldies. With NoMoreMouse, mastering VIM controls has never been easier.
