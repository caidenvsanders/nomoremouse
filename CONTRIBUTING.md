clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
If possible please provide a minimal demo of the problem.

## Issue Triage

Here are some tags that we're using to better organize issues in this repo:

* `good first issue` - Good candidates for someone new to the project to contribute.
* `help wanted` - Issues that should be addressed and which we would welcome a
PR for but may need significant investigation or work
* `support` - Request for help with a concept or piece of code but this isn't an
issue with the project.
* `needs more info` - Missing repro steps or context for both project issues \&
support questions.
* `discussion` - Issues where folks are discussing various approaches \& ideas.
* `question` - Something that is a question specifically for the maintainers such
as [this issue about the license](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/issues/1819).
* `documentation` - Relating to improving documentation for the project.
- Browser \& OS-specific tags for anything that is specific to a particular
environment (e.g. `chrome`, `firefox`, `macos`, `android` and so forth).

## Stability

Our philosophy regarding API changes is as follows:
 * We will avoid changing APIs and core behaviors in general
 * In order to avoid stagnation we will allow for API changes in cases where
 there is no other way to achieve a high priority bug fix or improvement.
 * When there is an API change:
    * Changes will have a well documented reason and migration path
